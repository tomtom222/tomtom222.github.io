                                Hello, my name is Thomas Loch and I am currently studying a Bachelor of Engineering
                                (Honours) majoring in Computer Systems. During high school I developed a passion for
                                electronics and aviation. I ended up studying aviation at Griffith University for 4
                                years, during this time I gained my commercial pilots license with a multi engine
                                command instrument rating. Due to the GFC and some regulatory changes, a large number
                                of small operators vanished in the year I graduated, so I was not able to get that all important first flying
                                job. From here I went on to working at Aldi, where I was promoted to a salaried manager
                                within my first year of being with the company. During this time, I continued learning
                                and experimenting with electronics (mainly Arduino). Once my passion was reignited, I
                                got a job at Pacific Data Systems. Here I was given the opportunity to develop my basic
                                skills into something much more. I went from basic through hole soldering and bread
                                boarding, to comfortably being able to rework down to 0402 size and designing pcbs
                                using Altium. This is the reason as to why I went back to university.
